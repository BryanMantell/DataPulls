*STEP 1: OPENING RAW DATA.
*Insert the correct file path and file name. Use syntax to open raw data file.
GET
  FILE='/Users/alexisadams-clark/Desktop/DBT Moms data management/Serv Mother Intake Survey_March 29, 2022_15.45.sav'.

*STEP 2: SAVING QUESTIONNAIRE SPECIFIC RAW DATA. 
*Insert the correct file path and file name. Save this file with only those variables that you need, in the following order; ID, Start Date, Questionnaire Items (i.e., DERS_1 to DERS_36).
  SAVE OUTFILE='/Users/alexisadams-clark/Desktop/DBT Moms data management/FQ0ODEMO_Cleaned.sav'
  /KEEP 
  ID
  StartDate
  FQ0ODEMO01_1 TO FQ0ODEMO23A
  /COMPRESSED.
  EXECUTE.

*STEP 3: OPEN NEW DATA FILE.  
*Insert the correct file path and file name. Open the file you just created and saved so that you are able to clean the data.
GET
  FILE='/Users/alexisadams-clark/Desktop/DBT Moms data management/FQ0ODEMO_Cleaned.sav'.

*STEP 4: TRANSFORM VARIABLES AND SORT IDS ASCENDING ORDER.
*Transforming ID from a string to a numeric variable, change the date format of startdate, and sort IDs in ascending order.
ALTER TYPE ID (F10.0).
EXECUTE.
FORMATS StartDate (adate10).
EXECUTE.
SORT CASES BY ID(A).
EXECUTE.

*STEP 5: RENAME ‘RAW DATA’ VARIABLES TO ‘CLEANED’ VARIABLES NAMES. 
*Rename all variables so they reflect our naming scheme. ID should always be labeled as 'ID'. Item should be numbers 01-36 or 001-106.  
RENAME VARIABLE (StartDate=FQ0ODEMODATE).
EXECUTE.

*Alexis also fixed the alphabet order in the 06letters.

*STEP 5A: MERGING FINAL ID FILE WITH CURRENT DATA FILE.
*This will ensure that all files have the correct # of enrolled and eligible IDs (Pitt=90; UO=88). Any missingness should be investigated (should they be missing?) and
labeled in STEP XX using information from the status (STAT) variable. If the status variable does not 'tell the whole story' (i.e., visit occured but data is missing),
missingness should be labeled by ID using syntax and notes in the syntax should provide information to justify the missing code.
*When using the syntax include which variables you want to DROP from the Assessment Summary file -- THE FULL LIST OF VARIABLES IS BELOW -- 
You should retain date (RD) and status (STAT) for the wave you are using (example below is A1; FD1ORD FD1OSTAT are REMOVED so that they are NOT dropped):
