*STEP 1: OPENING RAW DATA.
*Insert the correct file path and file name. Use syntax to open raw data file.
GET
  FILE='C:\Users\bryan\Desktop\Professional\Work\START\SPSS\DBT Moms R01 Study SBQ_PHQ_PAI-BOR Survey_February 14, 2022_16.26.sav'.

*STEP 2: SAVING QUESTIONNAIRE SPECIFIC RAW DATA. 
*Insert the correct file path and file name. Save this file with only those variables that you need, in the following order; ID, Start Date, Questionnaire Items (i.e., DERS_1 to DERS_36).
SAVE OUTFILE='C:\Users\bryan\Desktop\Professional\Work\START\SPSS\FQ0OPHQ_Cleaned.sav'
  /KEEP 
  ID 
  STARTDATE
  FQ0OPHQ_1 TO FQ0OPHQ10
  /COMPRESSED.
  EXECUTE.

*STEP 3: OPEN NEW DATA FILE.  
*Insert the correct file path and file name. Open the file you just created and saved so that you are able to clean the data.
GET
  FILE='C:\Users\bryan\Desktop\Professional\Work\START\SPSS\FQ0OPHQ_Cleaned.sav'.

*STEP 4: TRANSFORM VARIABLES AND SORT IDS ASCENDING ORDER.
*Transforming ID from a string to a numeric variable, change the date format of startdate, and sort IDs in ascending order.
ALTER TYPE ID (F10.0).
EXECUTE.
FORMATS STARTDATE (adate10).
EXECUTE.
SORT CASES BY ID(A).
EXECUTE.

*STEP 5: RENAME ‘RAW DATA’ VARIABLES TO ‘CLEANED’ VARIABLES NAMES. 
*Rename all variables so they reflect our naming scheme. ID should always be labeled as 'ID'. Item should be numbers 01-36 or 001-106. 
RENAME VARIABLE  (STARTDATE=FQ0OPHQDATE) (FQ0OPHQ_1 = FQ0OPHQ01) (FQ0OPHQ_2 = FQ0OPHQ02) (FQ0OPHQ_3 = FQ0OPHQ03) (FQ0OPHQ_4 = FQ0OPHQ04)
    (FQ0OPHQ_5 = FQ0OPHQ05) (FQ0OPHQ_6 = FQ0OPHQ06) (FQ0OPHQ_7 = FQ0OPHQ07) (FQ0OPHQ_8 = FQ0OPHQ08) (FQ0OPHQ_9 = FQ0OPHQ09).
EXECUTE.
*Remember to save your data file.
SAVE OUTFILE='C:\Users\bryan\Desktop\Professional\Work\START\SPSS\FQ0OPHQ_Cleaned.sav'.
EXECUTE.

*STEP 5A: MERGING FINAL ID FILE WITH CURRENT DATA FILE.
*This will ensure that all files have the correct # of enrolled and eligible IDs (Pitt=90; UO=88). Any missingness should be investigated (should they be missing?) and
labeled in STEP XX using information from the status (STAT) variable. If the status variable does not 'tell the whole story' (i.e., visit occurred but data is missing),
missingness should be labeled by ID using syntax and notes in the syntax should provide information to justify the missing code.
*When using the syntax include which variables you want to DROP from the Assessment Summary file -- THE FULL LIST OF VARIABLES IS BELOW -- 
You should retain the real date (RD) and status (STAT) for the wave you are using (example below is A1; FD1ORD FD1OSTAT are REMOVED so that they are NOT dropped from the file):
FD0OSTAT FD0ORD
FD1OSTAT FD1OTD FD1ORD FD1ODIFF

**STEP 7 (DELETE IF NOT NEEDED): CREATING NEW VARIABLES FOR REVERSED SCORED ITEMS.
**Reverse-Scored Items; see scoring document to determine if there are reverse-scored items. If no reverse-scored items, delete this syntax.

*STEP 7A: RECODING SYSMIS (PARTICIPANTS THAT MISSED THE ASSESSMENT).
*This will use the STAT variable to recode all SYSMIS data. CHANGE THE STAT VARIABLE TO MATCH THE ASSESSMENT WAVE YOU ARE WORKING IN.
*Include full list of numeric variables (including new reverse-scored items).

DO REPEAT x = FQ0OPHQ01 TO FQ0OPHQ10.
RECODE FD0OSTAT (ELSE=COPY) INTO x.
END REPEAT.

*STEP 8: STANDARDIZING DECIMAL PLACES (CANNOT INCLUDE TEXT/STRING VARIABLES).
*Making all variables have the same number of decimal places. Ensure that variables include all new reverse-scored variables. Change the number AFTER the decimal place as needed.
FORMATS FQ0OPHQ01 to FQ0OPHQ10 (F8.0).

*STEP 9: CREATING VARIABLE LABLES.
*Label all variables. Use the original questionnaire to include the exact text that participants saw. Include the questionnaire name and number at the end of the label.
